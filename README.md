<h1 align="center"><marquee>HTML5-marquee</marquee></h1>
<h3 align="center">A 'true to original' recreation of the legacy &lt;marquee> tag</h3>
  
# Author's notes

I tried to make it as close to the original as possible, so that it can be an effortless and complete replacement, even without changing a line of code. You just add this CSS file to your project and link it with the website.

# Installation

1. Download and extract the project: Click on the green "Download Code" button on the top right side of the file list. Select "Download ZIP" and extract the files inside the "css" folder upon opening.
2. Place the CSS file inside the website directory (recommended in the css folder): Copy or move the marquee.css and the marquee_min.css into the selected folder inside the website's directory.
3. Link the CSS file to the HTML documents: Open the HTML documents that need marquee to work, and search for the <head> tag. Make a line under it and add the following code there:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/marquee_min.css">
```
Replace the css directory (the part before the **/**) with your directory of choice if you chose another one.
